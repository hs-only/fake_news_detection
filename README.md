# Fake News Detector

## About
Our Fake News Detector model utilizes a Random Forest classifier, which has demonstrated excellent performance with a test accuracy of 96.82%.

## Model Details
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest
- **Test Accuracy:** 96.82%

## Dataset Information
The model was trained on a dataset consisting of labeled news articles, where each article was labeled as either "fake" or "true". The dataset was preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant information before being used for training the model.
